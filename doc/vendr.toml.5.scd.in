; vim:ft=scdoc
# NAME

vendr.toml - configuration file(s) for *vendr*

# SYNOPSIS

_vendr.toml_ [_\*.toml_]


# DESCRIPTION

_vendr.toml_ is read by *vendr* when invoked, however any valid _toml_ file may
be specified using the *-f* and *--file* options.

The format consists of two toml array sections: _repos_ and _files_.
_repos_ will be fetched with git according to the options specified in the given
entry. _files_ will be downloaded over the internet according to the options
specified.

# CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
For fields that are not required, their default value is shown in \[ \].

[[ *field*
:[ *type*
:[ *use in*
:[ *required?*
|  _name_
:  string
:  both
:  *true*
|  _url_
:  string
:  both
:  *true*
|  _path_
:  string
:  both
:  *false* [_name_]
|  _tag_
:  string
:  repos
:  *true*
|  _depth_
:  integer
:  repos
:  *false* [_1_]

# EXAMPLE

The following example uses both _files_ and _repos_ that *vendr* itself uses:

```
[[repos]]
name = "tomlplusplus"
url = "https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus.git"
path = "deps/tomlplusplus"
tag = "v3.4.0"

[[files]]
name = "args"
url = "https://github.com/taywee/args/archive/refs/tags/6.4.7.tar.gz"
path = "deps/args-6.4.7.tar.gz"

[[files]]
name = "cpr"
url = "https://github.com/libcpr/cpr/archive/refs/tags/1.12.0.tar.gz"
path = "deps/cpr-1.12.0.tar.gz"

[[repos]]
name = "libgit2"
url = "https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git"
path = "deps/libgit2"
tag = "v1.9.1"
depth = 0
```

## NOTE

Although as you might've noticed, in the "libgit2" entry, *depth* is set to a
value of _0_, this is for demonstrating that _0_ is considered infinite depth,
or a full clone of the repository history.
