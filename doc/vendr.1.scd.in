# NAME

*vendr* - easily vendor your projects' dependencies

# SYNOPSIS

*vendr* [_options_]

# DESCRIPTION

*vendr* is a tool for vendoring your software projects' dependencies. Its
creation was inspired by the lackluster capabilities of Git submodules.

With *vendr*, you can declare your dependencies in a simple _toml_ format;
whether they are source archives to download over the internet or Git
repositories to fetch at a specific tag.

# OPTIONS

*-f, --file* _path_
	Specify an alternate path for the file to read from. By default *vendr* uses
	a file in your current working directory name _vendr.toml_.

*-n, --name* _name_
	Specify an entry from the file by providing the value of its name field. By
	default *vendr* will fetch/download all entries.

*-w, --overwrite*
	This will cause existing files/directories to be overwritten upon running.
	By default *vendr* will skip over entries that already exist in the
	filesystem.

*-v, --verbose*
	This will cause *vendr* to be more verbose when documenting its actions at
	runtime.

*-m, --manual*
	Open this manual page for viewing.

*-h, --help*
	Display usage information.

*-V, --version*
	Display version information.

# FILES

*vendr.toml*
	The default behaviour is to use a file name _vendr.toml_ in your current
	working directory. This however of course can be changed at runtime with the
	*-f, --file* _path_ flags. The syntax of these files are documented in
	_vendr.toml_(5).

# ENVIRONMENT

*NO_COLOR*
	When present (regardless of value), *vendr* will omit usage of any colored
	terminal output. See _https://no-color.org_ for details about this community
	standard.
