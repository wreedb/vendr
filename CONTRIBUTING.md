Contributing to vendr
=====================
If you'd like to contribute to Vendr, you must agree that any and all 
merged contributions will be licensed under the **GNU General Public License** 
version 3 (or later). For information about this license, see the [license text](./LICENSE) 
included in the project source, or the corresponding page on [gnu.org](https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

Use of third-party code
-----------------------
If your contributions make use of (or vendor) any third-party code, you must 
ensure that the code in question is compatible for use in a project using the 
**GPLv3**. You must also make sure to enact any requirements made by the 
third-party license; such as including its license alongside **Vendr**. This 
project takes licensing extremely serious, and any contributions should reflect 
this.

Why are these policies so strict?
---------------------------------
Some developers wish to free themselves of interaction with copyright and 
licensing matters, however the idea of such freedom is not obtained through 
a hands-off approach. Freedom is not granting all to do as they wish; 
it is granting all to do as they wish without encroaching on others' freedom 
or having their freedom encroached upon.

Exceptions
----------
There are absolutely no exceptions.
